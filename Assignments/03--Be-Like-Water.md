# 03 -- Be fluid, like water...

![Like him...](http://i.giphy.com/3rHZo3Dv8F2CI.gif)

## Description

Now that you've taken a swing at [The Longform Tumblr theme](https://www.pixelunion.net/themes/tumblr/longform/), and we've built some of it together, it's time to do it all over again... from scratch.

First off, time to get some more of that essay written! [Rough Drafts](http://www.studygs.net/writing/roughdrafts.htm) are a "late stage of the writing process" that follows some level of [Prewriting Exercises](http://www.studygs.net/writing/prewriting.htm) like outlining, [mind mapping](http://www.mindmapping.com/), and brainstorming. If you feel you need some more prep work before you write a draft, take the time to put in that work first. You'll write a better essay and be happier with your draft.

Second, you've probably noticed that our HTML tags seem to be getting more complicated now that we're adding CSS to the mix. The HTML _attributes_ `class` and `id` are common to _all_ HTML tags... are there others? Go back to your `docs/HTML.md` file and document the _all_ the appropriate attributes for each tag in your library using the format provded in **Requirements**. Group the common -- or _global_ -- attributes into their own section.

If there were any pieces of HTML or CSS that you copied down today, spend some additional time researching and documenting them in your `docs/HTML.md` and `docs/CSS.md` files. Remember, these are for your own reference and self-education; reiterating information helps to synthesize it into knowledge.

#### The Iron Blog, Take 2 :clapper:

Now that you have a little direction, some experimental hacking, and some synthesized knowledge under your belt, take another swing that that theme. Start from scratch, really and truly: delete your code and start over. You'll thank me for it one day... probably some time in July.

Just for fun, I've included some emoji for each of the checkpoints this time around. **Start your commit messages with the emoji for each checkpoint as you complete them.** You know, for fun. Share in the HipChat room, too!

## Objectives

## Deliverables

* A new _WIP Issue_ in the class repository titled `03 -- Be Like Water -- YOUR NAME` with:
    * checkboxes for the *Tasks* under *Requirements*

    * documentation of the HTML attributes for the tags you've already documented added to `docs/HTML.md` per the format provided in **Requirements**
    * marked up design specifications (screenshots) in `specs/`
    * at least one commit clearing or deleting your `pub/index.html` file
    * multiple commits adding HTML and CSS into `pub/index.html` to provide a liquid-style layout that:
        * remains consistent at all screen sizes
        * becomes fixed-width at an appropriate "large" size
        * remains proportional while resized down
        * becomes fixed-width at an appropriate "small" size
* A Pull Request (PR) _from_ your feature branch _into_ `master` with:
    * a link back to your _WIP Issue_
    * 2x :thumbsup: from peers
    * **Don't check off on _any_ PR until you _see_ the code rendered and confirm it meets the requirements!**
