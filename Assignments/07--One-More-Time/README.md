# 07 -- One More Time

## Description

This "Responsive Web Design" stuff is hard. Today we discussed the differences between relative and absolute units, when to use `em` vs `%`, and how some of the `position` properties work. We started the Vertical Timeline project with a [Mobile-first](http://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp) approach.

Let's take another swing at that Vertical Timeline before circling back around to Surf & Paddle. There are a handful of you that made it through the entire layout with all three breakpoints. Buddy up with those that didn't and explain your work.

### Just Start Over

Everyone. Really, I mean it. Delete your work and start over. Build it all again, this time Mobile first. Stay in your buddy groups and work together. Help each other along. Make mistakes. Break stuff. Then fix it. Together.

## Deliverables

Same as [06 -- Now with 100% More Responsive!](06--Now-With-More-Responsive.md)... Really. Same branch, Issue, Pull Request, _everything_.

## Requirements

You guessed it. I'm looking for exactly the same thing.
