# 18 -- Hello, jQuery!

## Description

Man, that new jQuery tool looks all shiny and new. Let's get a handle on it before we start building that big TodoMVC project in groups.

### Go ahead and try it out...

On [the jQuery site](http://jquery.com), there a link to [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com), a Code School joint. Give that a run-through, but don't get stuck on anything. Just buy the answer and move forward. Use this course, like all the Code School courses, as a drill to practice on.

### Read the Documentation

Since I know you're not going to read [the documentation](http://api.jquery.com/), even if I tell you to, come up with your own strategy. This week we'll be covering these and more:

* Using [`jQuery(document).ready()`](http://api.jquery.com/ready/) and `jQuery(function(){ })`
* [Selectors](http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/)
* [Events](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/)
  * [`.on(function(event){ })`](http://api.jquery.com/on/)
  * [`.click(function(event){ })`](http://api.jquery.com/click/)
  * [`event.preventDefault()`](http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/)
* [CSS](http://api.jquery.com/category/css/)
  * [`.addClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/)
  * [`.removeClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/)
  * [`.toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/)

### Clean up your campsite...

Since you have some idea how the basic DOM API works in the Codrops to date, try refactoring them (and any other loose, er... pieces) before tackling the big assignment.

### What's in a Form?

To learn a _lot_ about HTML `<form>` elements and the tags inside of them, build this [Responsive Multi-Column Form](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/ResponsiveMultiColumnForm/). Totally use the Bootstrap CSS grid to get the responsiveness right (mobile-first!), but pay careful attention to the validation rules on those elements. Use the right `type` of `<input>` and see what happens!

#### Work _individually_; due on _Wednesday_!

### Getting Things Done

One of my least favorite tools for getting things done is writing everything down... But it's really popular and super-effective. If only I had an web app to help me. Wait, you can build me one!

Starting by [reading the specification](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/master/app-spec.md) and download [the template](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc-app-template/). You should have a _new_ repo called `TIY-TodoMVC` for this project. Issue 1 in that repo should be a break-down of the features in the spec, estimates for those features, and some task breakdown for the features, e.g. "checkpoints". Link your _WIP Issue_ to that issue.

#### Work in (different) groups of 3 or 4; due by _Thursday_!
