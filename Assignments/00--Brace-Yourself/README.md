### Prework -- Or what to do before you do anything else.

As your first assignment, [create a new Issue in the class repo](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING/issues/new) with the _raw_ contents of this file as the "description" (read [Mastering Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) for more).  Hint: look for the "Raw" button. You should end up with a bunch of checkboxes just like those below, thanks to [the way that Github interprets Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). As you complete tasks, check off the corresponding checkboxes. This is your **Work In Progress (WIP) Issue**. You'll create a new one for each Assignment to show your work and track your progress.

#### Extracurricular Activities

Regardless of how good you think you are at typing, a lot of the mistakes you make at first will be simple typographic errors. If you _don't_ know how to touch type (i.e. without looking at the keyboard), start practicing _now_ with http://www.keybr.com/. If you're fairly confident in your typing ability, try working through the JavaScript lessons on http://typing.io

As I recommended to you in your interviews, there are two books that I suggest you start reading. They're both avaialble in digital format on various devices, and they're both relatively easy reads:

* [_Getting Things Done_ by David Allen](http://j.mp/134jABk)
* [_Pragmatic Thinking and Learning_ by Andy Hunt](http://j.mp/1D5nmu8)

Finally, here are a couple of videos that I find inspirational and educational. We'll watch them again when class starts, but if you've got all this time on your hands:

* [_The Growth Mindset_ by Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh0OS4MrN3E)
* [Video Essays by Delve.TV](http://delve.tv/essays/)
   * [_The Long Game_, part 1](http://delve.tv/the-long-game-part-one/)
   * [_The Long Game_, part 2](http://delve.tv/the-long-game-part-2/)
