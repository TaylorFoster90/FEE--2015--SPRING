# 06 -- Now With 100% More Responsive!

## Description

Now you've built a liquid version of Surf & Paddle and taken a first stab at a liquid Vertical Timeline, but you know there's more... we've even built some of it together in class. Let's use what we've learned about Responsive Web Design (RWD) to build a mobile-friendly version!

From using the Mobile Inspector in Chrome Dev Tools to explore [the sample implementation](http://theironyard--orlando.github.io/FEE--2015--SPRING/), we can tell that there are 3 breakpoints: large, medium, and small. At the medium breakpoint, there are some slight font-size changes to accommodate the shrinking screen real estate. At the small breakpoint, however, the layout completely changes in an example of using different CSS on the same HTML to affect different layouts (see [CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com)). 

Your assignment is to implement those media queries and CSS overrides for the medium and small breakpoints. Start by dding design specs for them. Next, add media queries and CSS rules to duplicate that behavior. Remember if you change the HTML to accommodate the _small_ breakpoint, you might alter the layout of the other two by accident. Mind [the Rules of The Cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade): order, specificity, and inheritance.
