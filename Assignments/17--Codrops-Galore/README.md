# 17 -- Codrops Galore!

## Description

Based on what we walked through in class today, build the [Responsive Full Width Tabs](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/FullWidthTabs/) and complete the [Nested Accordion](http://tympanus.net/Blueprints/NestedAccordion/). You're free to use whatever tools we've covered in class, just not jQuery... yet. If you use Bootstrap, _just use the CSS grid!_

Make your own checklist for this one, kiddos...

Peace.
