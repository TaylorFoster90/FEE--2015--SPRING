# 08 -- Surf & Paddle, RWD Edition

## Description

You didn't think we were done, did you? Now that you've _mastered_ Responsive Web Design, let's take another look at our friends at Surf & Paddle Co. Our liquid layout doesn't really work past a certain screen size. To support mobile devices like tablets and phones, we need to make it responsive, and since we're now experts of mobile-first design... Well, do your best.

### Just Start Over. Again.

Wipe your directory clean, start the project fresh from HTML5 Boilerplate, and build a mobile-first layout for Surf & Paddle based on the design specs provided. Put your annotated mockups in `specs/` as before, and put your code in `index.html` and `css/main.css` to get the benefits of HTML5 Boilerplate. You might even consider using the breakpoints provided...

Finally, you'll note that the is no design direction for a medium or tablet view. Supply your own ideas. Get creative. Experiment. I wanna see at least three distinct layouts, though.

## Deliverables

* A new _WIP Issue_ in the class repo with tasks and estimates
* A new branch in `TIY-Assignments` named `08--surf+paddle+rwd` with:
  * a commit that deletes your previous assignment
  * a commit that imports HTML5 Boilerplate (use Yeoman, if you know how)
  * multiple commits to `pub/index.html` and `css/main.css` no more than 1 hour apart
  * a _pixel-perfect_ rendering of the full and small designs
  * a medium size layout and appropriate breakpoint
  * icons courtesy of Font Awesome, Glyphicons, or Octicons
  * placeholder text and images (linked, not downloaded)
* A PR from your feature branch to `master` with:
  * a link to your _WIP Issue_
  * a link to your `index.html` on [HTML Preview](http://htmlpreview.github.io)
  * feedback and 2x :+1:'s from your peers
* Comments on your _WIP Issue_ with:
  * a link to your PR
  * a checklist of bugs
