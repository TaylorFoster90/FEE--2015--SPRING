# 08 -- Surf & Paddle, RWD Edition

## Description

You didn't think we were done, did you? Now that you've _mastered_ Responsive Web Design, let's take another look at our friends at Surf & Paddle Co. Our liquid layout doesn't really work past a certain screen size. To support mobile devices like tablets and phones, we need to make it responsive, and since we're now experts of mobile-first design... Well, do your best.

### Just Start Over. Again.

Wipe your directory clean, start the project fresh from HTML5 Boilerplate, and build a mobile-first layout for Surf & Paddle based on the design specs provided. Put your annotated mockups in `specs/` as before, and put your code in `index.html` and `css/main.css` to get the benefits of HTML5 Boilerplate. You might even consider using the breakpoints provided...

Finally, you'll note that the is no design direction for a medium or tablet view. Supply your own ideas. Get creative. Experiment. I wanna see at least three distinct layouts, though.

### Build a Blog

Look at all the learning you've had! You should really tell the world about it. No, I don't mean Facebook... Blogging! Time to setup your new developer blog with [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com)! **Note:** If you already have a blog, this is still a valuable exercise.

Use the Github interface to create a new repository called `USERNAME.github.io` with a `README.md` and `LICENSE` file... but also add a `.gitignore` file for "Jekyll" projects (there's a drop-down for that). Next, drop an `index.html` file inside the repo with a simple "Hello World!" heading, and visit `http://USERNAME.github.io` (where `USERNAME` is _your_ Github profile name, of course). Hello, Blog! Wait, what?

This could be so much nicer... Too bad you don't know how to build a blog template. Oh, wait! You do! Use [the Longform theme](https://www.pixelunion.net/themes/tumblr/longform/) as a reference, and build yourself a blog site to match. This will continue to evolve as your skills advance... It's a Github repo, after all. Customize to your heart's content or just keep it simple and straight-forward. Start with HTML5 Boilerplate and end up pixel-perfect! :shamrock:
