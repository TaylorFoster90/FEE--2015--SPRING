# 01 -- Get your own MF'g Website...

## Description

Your first task is to start a little essay project. Watch the videos on [Khan Academy's "You Can Learn Anything" page](https://www.khanacademy.org/youcanlearnanything), [Carol Dweck's "The Power of Yet" TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve), and follow up with [this brief video on Growth Mindsets](http://ed.ted.com/on/UA77FlTc). Find some additional resources on the internet about Dr Carol Dweck (there are plenty). Explain the key differences between the _Growth Mindset_ and the _Fixed Mindset_ with some simple bullet points; start documenting some ways you can relate.

After that, you'll need to practice some `git` commands. Head over to [Try Git](http://try.github.com), a CodeSchool production, and learn you somethin'. Do yourself a favor: _treat this course as a practice drill_. Don't think of it as a video game that you have to beat (and then never look at again). Instead, try to get through the whole tutorial in one sitting; even take the answer if you get stuck! Write down what you don't get yet and try it again later. Ask questions. Break stuff. Repeat.

Next, use [the HTML documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to document 10 _block-level_ HTML tags, their attributes, and some example usage. The ones we've already covered -- headings and paragraphs -- don't count. Use the format provided below under "Requirements".

### Now that you know HTML... :astonished:

Use what you've learned to build your own MF'g website. Don't go cray-cray, just use the typographic elements you've just researched _as appropriate_ to duplicate the content on [The Iron Yard -- About](http://theironyard.com/about) and [The Iron Yard -- Culture](http://theironyard.com/about/culture) pages.

## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand the "Growth Mindset" and the "Fixed Mindset" concepts.
* Understand the bare minimum necessary to build an HTML document.
* Understand the basics and benefits of `git`, Github, and Source Control.
* Be familiar with several different HTML tags, their appropriate usage and "default formatting".
* Be familiar with basic Markdown syntax: bullets, paragraphs and headings.

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use...

* Github to:
    * create a branch   
    * create and edit files and folders (directories)
    * open a Pull Request (PR) from a branch
    * create and link Issues to PRs
* `git` to:
    * create a named branch and view all branches
    * check the status and changes to "local" files
    * add and commit changes to the "local" index
    * push "local" changes to a Github "remote"
* Markdown and HTML to present structured content.

## Deliverables

* [A _WIP Issue_ in the class repo](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/FEE--2015--SPRING/issues) titled `01 -- MF'g Website -- YOUR NAME` with:
    * checkboxes as below under _Requirements_
    * estimates for the top-level checkboxes
* A page in the wiki for _your_ `TIY-Assignments` repo named _Growth and Fixed Mindsets_ that contains:
    * bullet points describing key attributes of the Growth Mindset and the Fixed Mindset
    * three or more bullets about your experience and how you can relate to both mindsets
* A branch in _your_ `TIY-Assignments` repo named `feature/01--mfg-website` that contains:
    * a series of commits no more than 1 hour apart (use good "why" messages!)
    * A folder called `docs/` that contains:
        * `HTML.md` -- a Markdown file with your HTML examples
    * A folder called `pub/` that contains:
        * `about.html` -- your MF'g version of the "About" page
        * `culture.html` -- your MF'g version of the "Culture" page
* A Pull Request (PR) in _your_ `TIY-Assignments` repo:
    * _from_ branch `feature/01--mfg-website` (head)
    * _into_ branch `master` (base)
    * description that links to your _WIP Issue_ in the class repo using _Github Flavored Markdown_
    * two :thumbsup: comments from peers who have reviewed your work
* Comments on your _WIP Issue_ for the following:
    * a link to your wiki page (absolute URL)
    * a link to your PR using _Github Flavored Markdown_

### Format for _Reading HTML_

Use the following format for your own "Reading HTML" file: `docs/HTML.md`. Please take careful note of the lack of line breaks after the _example_ bullet, if you want your formatting to look like mine. Anything unexpected in the way Github renders your Markdown file? Add it to your _WIP Issue_ as a comment so we can discuss it in class.
