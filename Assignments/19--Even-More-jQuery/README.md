# 19 -- Even More jQuery!

## Description

I'm sure all that jQuery you just learned will come in handy in day 2 of TodoMVC. See below for some other pieces of the jQuery API that might help you. On your own, build a _responsive_ version of your Github profile. You'll need to use the Chrome Mobile Inspector to discover the mobile-adaptive view of your profile.

### Getting _More_ Things Done

Keep working in your teams to complete your TodoMVC implementation with jQuery. You'll need to learn some more jQuery to complete the next set of features:

#### [jQuery Documentation](http://api.jquery.com)

* [DOM Manipulation](https://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/)
  * [`.clone()`](https://api.jquery.com/clone/)
  * [`.append()`](https://api.jquery.com/append/) vs [`.appendTo()`](https://api.jquery.com/appendTo/)
  * [`.remove()`](https://api.jquery.com/remove/)
* [Effects](https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/)
  * [`.hide()`](https://api.jquery.com/hide/)
  * [`.show()`](https://api.jquery.com/show/)
* [Manipulating Forms](https://api.jquery.com/category/forms/)
  * [`.submit()`](https://api.jquery.com/submit/)
  * [`.val()`](https://api.jquery.com/val/)

### Github Profile, Part 0

You may have noticed that Github just _isn't_ responsive, and that really bothers me. But there _are_ mobile views for most pages on Github... Just check out your profile page in the Chrome Mobile Inspector! _Let's show 'em how it's done!_

Start with HTML5 Boilerplate, use Bower to install Bootstrap, and replicate [Octocat's Github profile](http://github.com/octocat) page as a mobile-first responsive site. **Pro Tip:** viewing the source from Github won't help; it's a mess.

Start with a MF'g version of it, use Bootstrap to add responsive layout with the grid classes, then try adding [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/). If you're looking for all those Github-themed icons, check out [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/), which works exactly how you might think.

Finally, add a simple `<form>` to the bottom of the profile that looks _exactly_ like the one at the bottom of every _WIP Issue_ you've ever made. It doesn't need to _do_ anything... yet. We'll wire it up tomorrow.

**NOTE:** I _am_ looking for a _finished_ product for this assignment, as we'll be building on this on Thursday.
