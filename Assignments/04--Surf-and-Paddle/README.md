# 04 -- Surf and Paddle: The Tradition

## Description

Let's put the rubber to the road! It's time for your first decently scary weekend project. Don't worry, you'll do fine. Just use everything you've learned this week, learn a lot more, and put everything you've got into it!

First, get working on a First and Second Draft of your essay. Solicit reviews from your peers and listen and incorporate their feedback on your writing and your story. Return the favor.

Next, if there's anything left hanging over your head from the last week, finish it up! If you didn't get to all of your documentation, aren't happy with your outline or rough draft, or haven't completed a full pass at The Iron Blog, allocate some time to catch up. The weekend will be over before you know it though, so be judicious about your time.

Finally, it's time to put your skills to the test. I've provided you a design specification for a single HTML page. Use Skitch to break down that design into smaller bite-sized chunks, estimate them, and start executing. You'll be using HTML5 Boilerplate, Lorem Ipsum, placeholder images, and everything you know about HTML and CSS to provide a _pixel perfect_ liquid layout.

Split up into teams or pairs to compare Skitch specs, but the HTML and CSS build-out is _an individual assignment_. Help each other out, talk through ideas and discuss research, but write your own code.

## Deliverables

* A new _WIP Issue_ named `04 -- Surf & Paddle -- YOUR NAME` with tasks and estimates.
* _At least two (2) drafts_ of your essay:
