Assignment 18: Hello, jQuery!

* [ ] **Homework Review** ~30m
* [ ] **Tools on Tuesday**
  * [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
    * Included in HTML5 Boilerplate!
    * Let's use it in our Accordion!
    * But why such an old version?
  * [Bower](http://bower.io)
    * Separate client-side libraries from command-line
    * Isomorphic JavaScript digression...
    * Let's get it!
      * `npm install -g bower`
      * `bower install jquery`
      * `bower init`
    * Shave some yaks!
    * What's with updating those `src` attributes?
  * [`wiredep`](http://github.com/taptapship/wiredep)
    * Add some HTML comments...
    * It wires up your dependencies for you!
    * How do we use it?
      * `npm install -g wiredep`
      * `wiredep -s path/to/file.html`
    * Let's try it with Bootstrap!
      * `bower install --save bootstrap`
      * `wiredep -s index.html`
    * What's with all this typing?
